# Arduino based MIDI sequencer

### This project was built as a final project for the Introduction To Robotics course at the Faculty of Mathemathics and Computer Science from the University of Bucharest, Romania.

### The project consists of a device that can send MIDI messages to control other MIDI-enabled devices, such as synthesizers.

### Sadly, I didn't have the time to do all the codigng for the project so it has unifinished functionalities. In the demonstration video I will only show the working features of the device.

In the demonstration video, the sequencer is connected to a small synthesizer via a MIDI cable and sends to it sequences of notes that can be modified while the sequence is playing.
